## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please use the "Report a vulnerability" button on the GitHub projects [Security page](https://github.com/dextercd/Handtokening/security) to report vulnerabilities.

If you can't use the GitHub option for some reason, then please open an issue or send an email to dexter.c.dopping@gmail.com to discuss a secure vulnerability reporting method that works for you.
